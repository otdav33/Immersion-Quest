    "pretext": "Katakana is another writing system in Japanese that is mainly used for words borrowed from foreign languages or just simply foreign words. They are also used for emphasis. Katakana uses the same set of sounds as hiragana but they are represented by different characters. The characters in katakana are a lot sharper and blockish than hiragana. Because of this, hiragana is sometimes regarded as a feminine form of writing while katakana and kanji are seen as more masculine."
