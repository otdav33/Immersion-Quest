    "pretext": "English is a subject-object-verb language, meaning that English sentences are generally composed of a subject, then a verb, then an object. E.g. \"I eat fruit\" would have \"I\" be the subject, \"eat\" be the verb and \"fruit\" be the object. In Japanese, word order does not tell you which thing is the subject and which is the object. Instead, you can use particles. The particle to mark the object is \"を\" (it is called the \"object marker particle\"). For example, to say \"apples are eaten,\" you would say \"りんごを食べる\"",

It's just that \"私はジュースを飲む\" is equivalent to \"ジュースを私は飲む。\"</p><p>Note: Which one is most natural depends on the context. For example, if someone asked, \"What do you drink?\" you might respond with \"私はジュースを飲む.\" But if someone asked, \"Who drinks the juice?\" you might respond with \"ジュースを私は飲む\" to emphasize that it is you who drinks the juice. It's a small detail that you don't really have to worry about.</p>",
