If it is clear that you are talking about yourself, you can just say the equivalent of \"drink water.\" In fact, you don't have to say what you are drinking either.

It's just a drawing of a dude drinking, but as time went on, it changed bit by bit. The radical (part of character) 食 means \"eat\" or \"food\" and the radical 欠 is an unrelated character that kind of looks like a person bending over to drink something. Both of these are characters on their own, but not all radicals are.
