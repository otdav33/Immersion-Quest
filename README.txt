This is a language learning web app that uses vanulla javascript and is built on top of firebase.

At the time of writing, a running instance can be found at https://immersion-quest.com/ or https://languagelearn.web.app/

Usage: Set up a normal firebase project with webpack like on the official firebase documentation, then drag and drop all the files in. The lesson editor needs to be hosted as a separate project if you want to use it.

It has Japanese lessons in it right now.

Please read the .md files in their appropriate locations for further details. Startup info is in the general architecture one for once you get firebase set up.
