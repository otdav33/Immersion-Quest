This is a language learning web app that uses vanulla javascript and is built on top of firebase. Set up a normal firebase project with webpack like on the official firebase documentation, then drag and drop all the files in. The lesson editor needs to be hosted as a separate project if you want to use it.

It has Japanese lessons in it right now.

Once you get everything going, you run "npm run build" or "npm build run" or something like that to build and upload it all to the firebase server.
